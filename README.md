# HangmanGame

This is my final python project for Code Louisville.

The project includes the following required features;


Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code.


Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.


Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.


Analyze text and display information about it
