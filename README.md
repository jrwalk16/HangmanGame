This is my final python project for Code Louisville.

The project includes the following required features;


Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code.
(created functions to generate word as well as to display letters guessed/missed

Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
(created a dictionary of words the game chooses from for the player to guess)

Analyze text and display information about it
(program tracks player guesses and shows which letters they guessed as well as fill in the blanks of the word)
